The Antenna is a quick deployable analog hydro acoustic receiver compatible with the Underwater GPS G2 system. The Antenna is equipped with 4 Receiver-A1 with large dynamic range followed by advanced digital signal processing functionality when connected to the Underwater GPS G2 topside unit.

## Benefits

* Foldable to minimize space during travel (54 x 12.5 x 14.5 cm).

* Quick deployable to minimize setup time.

* Small baseline (98 x 53.5 cm) suitable for small boats and tanks/pools.

* Highly robust operation in areas with reflections (shallow water, around installations etc.)

* Includes C-Size RAM Mount fixtures for universal mounting capabilities.

## Wiring interface

The Antenna comes with 10 meters of cable. This is the maximum cable length available for the Antenna due to noise limitations on the analog signals.
